# ipBatTool
A windows bash based ip tool


This tool is made by @Spear_Ace 
The intent of this project is to create a simple to use ip tool that has the following function
1. Ping infinitly the target ip(until ctrl-c are pressed)
2. Trace the target ip and stores it into ~\traced.txt
3. Change your target ip
4. Displays your target ip
5. An option to quit by pressing "q"(wow!)
